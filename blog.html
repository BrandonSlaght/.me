      <h2>
        The mess that is Android
      </h2>
      <p>
        Recently, thanks to my Android app development class, I've gotten into Android programming, and as a result, I've noticed how deeply flawed the platform is.  Now, I am no stranger to Android.  My first smartphone was a Droid 2, I have a Galaxy S 4 & Galaxy Tab 10.1, and I know my way around custom roms, rooting, bootloaders and the like.  But to be honest, I hadn't actually used an Android phone in 4 years until about a month ago when I found that GS4.  I booted it up, hoping to see that Android had improved, but alas, it had made no progress in 4 years.  The same problems still plagued the platform: 
      </p>
      <h3>
        Bloatware
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is the most infuriating problem to me.  It's like phone makers are willing to deliberately sacrifice software quality in order to make some extra cash.  This may make sense for low end, $0 on contract phones, but what about a $200 flagship smartphone?  When I reset and updated the GS4, I ended up with over 50 preinstalled apps.  3 music apps, 2 video apps, 2 messaging apps, countless AT&T apps trying to sell extra services that nobody ever uses, among a dozen other apps which added abolutely nothing to the device.  All of these were permanent and not removable to the average user.  A few of them even spammed notifications daily.  So much bloat fills up a phone and detracts from the user experience.  iOS and even Windows Phone do not have this problem.  
      </p>
      <h3>
        Vulnerabilities
      </h3>
      <p>
        Recently, two major vulerabilities in Android surfaced: one allowing <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/hack-brief-new-emergency-number-hack-easily-bypasses-android-lock-screens/">attackers to bypass user's lockscreens</a>, and another <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/stagefright">in the media decoder</a>, both affecting millions of devices.  Software as complicated as an operating system is generally insecure, but most operating systems are updated continuously.  In theory, Android is too, but millions of devices affected by these vulnerabilities will remain vulnerable due to the last problem:
      </p>
      <h3>
        Lack of Updates
      </h3>
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Android 6.0 images are out! I have a *single* Android device that’s eligible (…out of 30?) <a href="https://t.co/rbaKQem9hl">https://t.co/rbaKQem9hl</a> /via <a href="https://twitter.com/b3ll">@b3ll</a></p>&mdash; Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/651218345174265860">October 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

      <p>
        My Droid 2 got one official update, from 2.2 to 2.3.  Keep in mind, this was a flagship, top of the line phone, and there was no excuse for Motorola to drop support so quickly.  This fate happens to many phones, even recently.  Motorola will end support for the Moto E, <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/02/wtf-motorola-marketed-the-moto-e-2015-on-promise-of-updates-is-now-apparently-ending-them-after-219-days/">after 219 days, 1 update, and the promise of more.</a>  Many phone manufacturers seem to drop support for devices after a year or so, halfway through a standard phone contract.  Contrast this to Apple, who recently made iOS 9 avaiable on the iPhone 4s, a phone that launched 4 years ago, on the same day that everyone else got it.  This problem makes Android a nightmare for developers, as we have to target year-old api levels in order to capture compatibility with a reasonable number of devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        These issues in Android seriously need to be adressed in order for it to compete long term with iOS.  Google could easily leverage carriers and manufacturers to fix these flaws, which leaves me to question why they haven't yet.
